## Objective:
This project aims to develop a user-friendly web application similar to SeatGeek, a popular online ticketing platform. The application will focus on providing a streamlined interface, enhanced event discovery features, and real-time ticket availability updates to ensure a seamless and engaging experience for event enthusiasts. As a student project, it offers an opportunity to gain practical experience in building a complex real-world platform using modern web technologies. The application will tackle challenges such as event data aggregation, ticket inventory management, real-time updates, and integration with third-party services. Users will be able to easily browse and discover a wide range of events, from concerts and sports games to theatre performances and festivals, with personalized recommendations and a user-friendly ticket management system, simplifying the event-going experience and ensuring they never miss out on their favorite events.
